## A1/A3 - Sustainable Yield Curve

```{r}
# Calculate the growth rate for a vector of N's
log_growth_rate <- function(r,N,K){
  dNdt = r*N*(1-(N/K))
  return(dNdt)
}

# Set Initial Conditions
r = 0.6 # units: fish per year
K = 3200 # units: tonnes
N = 0:K

# Calculate dNdt and graph
dNdt = log_growth_rate(r,N,K)
plot(N,dNdt, type = "l", lwd = 2, ylim = range(dNdt), xlim = range(N), col = "black", main = "Sustainable Yield Curve", xlab = "Population Size (tonnes)", ylab = "Growth Rate (tonnes of fish/year)")

# Add MSY Point
points(equil_stock_size,msy, pch = 16, col = "red", lwd = 5)

legend("topleft", legend = c("SYC","MSY"), col = c("black","red"), lty = c(1, NA), pch = c(NA, 16), lwd = c(2,5))

```

## A2 - Maximum Sustainable Yield

```{r}
# Set Initial Conditions
r = 0.6 # units: fish per year
K = 3200 # units: tonnes

# Calculate MSY and equilibrium stock size
msy = (r*K)/4
msy
equil_stock_size = K/2
equil_stock_size

```

## B1 - 18% Graph

```{r}
# Set Initial Conditions
r = 0.6 # units: fish per year
K = 3200 # units: tonnes
N = 0:K

# Calculate dNdt and 18%
dNdt = log_growth_rate(r,N,K)
dNdt_18 = dNdt * 0.18 # Is this what you're looking for?

# Graph
plot(N,dNdt, type = "l", lwd = 2, ylim = range(dNdt), xlim = range(N), col = "black", main = "Sustainable Yield Curve", xlab = "Population Size (tonnes)", ylab = "Growth Rate (tonnes of fish/year)")
lines(N,dNdt_18, lwd = 2, lty = 2, ylim = range(dNdt), xlim = range(N), col = "red")
legend("topleft", legend = c("SYC","18% SYC"), col = c("black","red"), lty = c(1, 2), lwd = c(2,2))
```

## B2 - Estimate Harvest and Stock Limits

I'm not sure how to do this

## B3 - Total Harvest

```{r}

```
