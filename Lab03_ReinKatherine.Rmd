## A1 - Continuous Growth (10 weeks)

```{r}
# Define a continuous exponential growth function
con_exp_growth <- function(N_initial, r, NT){
  t_cont = 0:NT
  N = N_initial * exp(r*t_cont)
  return(N)
}

# Set initial conditions
r = 0.4
N_initial = 38
NT = 10

# Call function and graph
N = con_exp_growth(N_initial, r, NT)
plot(0:NT, N, type = 'l', main = "Continuous Exponential Growth Function", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Population Size", col = "DarkBlue")
```

## A2 - Discrete Growth

```{r}
# Define a discrete exponential growth function
dis_exp_growth <- function(N_initial, r, NT){
  R = exp(r)
  t_dis = 0:NT
  N = rep(N_initial,NT+1)
  
  for(t in 1:NT){
    N[t+1] = R*N[t]
  }
  return(N)
}

# Set initial conditions
r = 0.4
N_initial = 38
NT = 10

# Call function and graph
N = dis_exp_growth(N_initial, r, NT)
plot(0:NT, N, type = 'l', main = "Discrete Exponential Growth Function", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Population Size", col = "DarkBlue")
```

## A3 - Doubling Time

```{r}
# Define a doubling time function
doubling_time <- function(r){
  double_time = (exp(2))/r
  return(double_time)
}

# Set initial conditions
r = 0.4

# Call function and output answer
double_time = doubling_time(r)
rounded_double_time = round(double_time,2)
print(paste("The doubling time according to both the discrete and continuous functions is", rounded_double_time))
```

## A4 - Both Curves One Graph

```{r}
# Set initial conditions
r = 0.4
N_initial = 38
NT = 10

# Call functions
N_con = con_exp_growth(N_initial, r, NT)
N_dis = dis_exp_growth(N_initial, r, NT)

# Graph both functions
plot(0:NT, N_con, type = 'l', main = "Exponential Growth Functions", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Population Size", col = "DarkBlue", lwd = 2)
lines(0:NT, N_dis, type = 'l', main = "Exponential Growth Functions", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Population Size", col = "Red", lty = 4, lwd = 2)
